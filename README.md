# PLMPA
Developed PLMPA in Java, integrating modules to scrape Premier League tables and fixtures using Jsoup, extracting and storing data in CSV files. The program allows users to predict match outcomes, view head-to-head statistics, simulate full seasons, and analyze league tables and teams across various English Premier League seasons. Each feature accesses the scraped data from CSV files and applies simple math models and algorithms to generate season predictions and performance insights. This tool provides an interactive way to predict and analyze multiple seasons and teams by combining web scraping, data extraction, and manipulation.
